# Final Project

Create a website that uses APIs to display data in a meaningful way. The website should have a homepage that explains what the website does and how to use it. The website should have at least two other pages that display data from APIs. The website should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile.

## Requirements
- Make **at least** following API calls:
    - [x] List of items
    - [x] Details of an item
    - [x] Search for an item
    - [x] Pagination
- DOM mainpulation, fetched data should be displayed on the pages:
    - [x] Create a page for list of items (This should include search and pagination)
    - [x] Create a page for details of an item
- Use localStorage to store user preferences (e.g. dark mode)
- Use sessionStorage to store temporary data (e.g. shopping cart)
- Use cookies to store user data (e.g. username)
- Use JavaScript imports to modularize your code
